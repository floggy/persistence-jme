/**
 * An interface representing a search result. The 
 * <code>PolymorphicObjectSet</code> logically maintains a sequence of the 
 * object's IDs. It is possible to iterate over all objects (or a subset, if an 
 * optional object filter has been supplied) using the 
 * <code>get(int index)</code> method. <br>
 * <br>
 * <code>
 * PersistableManager pm = PersistableManager.getInstance();<br>
 * PolymorphicObjectSet os = manager.polymorphicFind(Customer.class, null, null);<br>
 * for(int i = 0; i < os.size(); i++) {<br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;Customer customer = (Customer) os.get(i);<br>
 * &nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>
 * }
 * </code><br>
 * <br>
 * By using an optional <code>Filter</code>, only the objects that matches
 * the provided filter will be avaiable in this set.<br>
 * <br>
 * By using an optional <code>Comparator</code>, the order of the objects in
 * this set will be determined by the comparator.
